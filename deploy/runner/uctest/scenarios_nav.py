"""uctest nav suite — the PATHFINDER regression gate (RW-8).

WHY THIS EXISTS. The block-space search is about to be reworked (unified move
generation, real g-cost accumulation, physics-A* dedup). Every one of those changes
alters routing globally, and without a graded course set there is no way to tell a fix
from a regression — which is exactly how "it could always do parkour before"
happened. This suite is the gate: run it BEFORE a search change to get a baseline, and
after every change to prove nothing fell over.

Courses are graded easy -> hard and each isolates ONE capability, so a red tells you
which move type broke rather than just "navigation is worse". Every course also records
time-to-goal and client FPS, which doubles as the PERF-1 baseline.

Nothing here needs a victim; the bot navigates alone.

    """A SIX-block drop straight ahead, and a safe stepped way down beside it.

    ⛔ THIS COURSE EXISTS BECAUSE NOTHING COULD SEE A WHOLE CLASS OF BUG. The pathfinder carries a
    complete fall-damage guard -- PathFinder.checkForFallDamage, plus six more checks in Node,
    BlockNode and the special moves -- and it was DISABLED by default for as long as the port has
    existed. Twelve nav courses stayed green throughout, because the deepest drop any of them
    offers is three blocks and the guard's threshold is 2.75. A course that only offers SAFE drops
    cannot test a guard against unsafe ones; it passes identically whether the guard runs or not.

    Measured on the playthrough instead, which is a nine-minute run on a live world and therefore
    the worst possible place to learn it: the bot descended from y=134 to y=60 and took 25.3
    damage, four of four events attributed to no living entity at all (falls, void, fire). One run
    reached wood tools and spent its last 150 seconds chipping stone on 1.5 hp.

    The layout gives the bot a CHOICE, which is what makes the verdict mean something:
      * straight ahead, a six-block cliff onto the lower shelf -- fast, and it hurts;
      * one row to the side, three two-block steps down to the same shelf -- safe.
    Both reach the goal, so 'reached' cannot distinguish them and the HEALTH is the measurement.

    ⛔ WHAT THIS COURSE DOES **NOT** MEASURE, recorded because I built it expecting otherwise.
    It does not discriminate the fall-damage flag. Three builds were tried -- a 6-block drop with
    stairs beside it, a 10-block drop with a detour, and the 5-block drop that ships here -- and on
    an arena the bot reaches the goal with min_hp=20.0 in EVERY one of them, guard on or off. At
    ten blocks it stopped reaching the goal at all (final_dist=19.4, freezes=15) with the guard
    OFF, so that depth is past what the planner will take regardless. The bot does not choose a
    damaging fall here, which means the playthrough's 25.3 damage is NOT explained by "the planner
    picks damaging drops" -- that model is unsupported and is not claimed.

    ⭐ WHAT IT DOES MEASURE, and why it earns its place: it is the only course with a drop past the
    guard's 2.75 threshold, so it is the only one that exercises the guard's code path at all. That
    is enough to catch the bug that motivated it -- the guard used to TRUNCATE the fall simulation
    mid-air instead of rejecting the move, and a bot with the guard on froze solid. With the fix,
    guard on reaches the goal in 8.3s against 12.2s with it off. Before the fix that arm would not
    have arrived.

    Gates: reach the goal, no freezes, and arrive with full health.

class NavNotch(NavCourse):
    """A diagonal whose BOTH corner columns are solid: the bot must route around, not into it.

    HONEST LABEL FIRST: this course does NOT reproduce the playthrough stall it was built for.
    It passes in about seven seconds, which is the bot routing around the notch exactly as it
    should. Shipping it with a docstring claiming otherwise would repeat the mistake nav_hazard
    records two courses down -- a course that passed four of four with its hazard counter at zero,
    i.e. for the wrong reason.

    WHAT IT DOES GUARD is worth keeping: a diagonal step whose two corner columns are both full
    cannot be squeezed through in vanilla, and a router that commits to one stands in it until the
    clock runs out. The layout offers the blocked diagonal as the SHORT way and an open lane one
    row over as the long one, so arriving means the route declined the impossible step.

    WHY THE REAL STALL NEEDS MORE THAN THIS GEOMETRY, traced on the live world block by block:

        src        (85,124,-54)  AIR          the cell the movement was built from
        srcAbove   (85,125,-54)  air          where the feet actually are
        cornerA    (85,125,-55)  grass_block  SOLID, at the body's real level
        cornerB    (84,125,-54)  dirt         SOLID, at the body's real level
        cornerAlow (85,124,-55)  air          and THIS is the corner that got vetted

    The trigger is not the notch, it is that the movement was built from a cell one block BELOW
    the body, so MovementDiagonal vetted its corners a level down where one of them is open. That
    off-by-one comes from the route, not from the terrain, and terrain alone cannot force it --
    which is why this course is green and the stall is not fixed.

    It then holds forward at v=0.00 and never completes, and that is not one lost step: while a
    chain is RUNNING the mixin returns early and NOTHING else ticks -- not BlockPathWalker, not
    the build primitives, not the physics executor -- while FastNavigator counts isRunning() as
    "building" and never replans. Measured on a five-minute run: mqStarted=64 against mqSteps=9,
    dbTargets=12/0, no rungs at all.

    The course lives in the arena rather than on the live world deliberately (checklist rule
    4a3): the earlier repro sat on real terrain and the bot DUG IT AWAY -- grass_block and dirt at
    those corners both read air a few dozen runs later, after which it stopped reproducing in both
    arms and measured nothing while looking exactly like a fix. An arena course is rebuilt every
    run, so it cannot be eaten.

    Built because the nether deaths could not be measured any other way that answers in a minute.
    Twelve-minute stints from a checkpoint gave 40-60% survival with a spread wider than any fix
    chased through them, and by 0.95.37 every remaining death had a different shape. The one shape
    the stints kept showing, and the one this course isolates, is EXECUTOR DRIFT beside lava: the
    plan holds no lava cell and the body still ends one block off it (route-relative snapshot d1.0,
    d1.4, d1.0 from the nearest waypoint) -- under the walker, the queue and the replay executor.

    The layout leaves no margin to take: the only way to the goal is a 1-wide stone lane with lava
    on both sides at floor level (a block of stone under the lava, so it stays put). Halfway the lane
    jogs sideways by two, so a route that cuts the corner puts the feet in lava. Nothing else
    reaches the goal, so the planners' margins (0.95.36/37) fall back to the bare route by design and
    what is measured is whether the EXECUTORS keep the body on the lane.

    Gates: reach the goal, NO LAVA ENTRY (lavaEntryStats, before vs after -- the instrument that
    found the nether mechanism), and no damage.

    ⛔ WHAT THIS COURSE DOES NOT DO, MEASURED THE DAY IT WAS BUILT (checklist RULE SIX). It does not
    reproduce the nether drift: the 0.95.29 release -- no executor-side lava checks at all -- passes it
    3/3 under BOTH drives (tungsten gotoXYZ, 10.2 s; the altoclef @goto the playthrough uses, 6.6-10.2
    s), exactly as 0.95.37 does (6.6 s). A flat, straight 1-wide lane does not make the executors
    drift. The deaths it was meant to catch come with height changes -- a sprint jump up a step next
    to a drop, a straight-down drop on a non-full floor block, executor hand-offs -- and none is here.
    So it is kept as a GUARD, not a discriminator: it fails if a safety check ever stops the bot
    walking a lane beside lava (the flood and the nether both require that), and it says nothing
    about whether a fix reduced drift. Do not quote a pass here as evidence of one.
