        LOAD-SENSITIVE, AND THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED. I first reasoned the opposite:
        a self-duel is symmetric, both sides are equally starved, so no frame rate excuses losing
        to yourself. The symmetry argument is about whether the fight is FAIR. It says nothing
        about whether the result is INFORMATIVE, and the run below settles that.

        Two full pvp suites, hours apart, against a BIT-IDENTICAL jar (0.73.0, built before both,
        mtime checked). Three of twelve courses returned a different verdict, and the flips are
        not spread at random:

            melee_basic         PASS -> FAIL     7.2 fps    this gate
            narrow_bridge_duel  PASS -> FAIL     8.9 fps    this gate

        Every mutual duel judged by THIS criterion flipped. Every objective course -- reach the
        far side, cross the bridge, route around the wall -- held. That is exactly the shape you
        get when a starved client turns a fight into a coin toss while leaving navigation
        deterministic, and a coin toss recorded as a bot failure is the precise error the
        starvation guard exists to prevent.

        Deliberately NOT flagged with it: `self-falls == 0` and `bot deaths <= 0`. They failed in
        BOTH runs rather than flipping, so there is no evidence they are noise, and flagging a
        gate on suspicion is how the keyword whitelist grew wrong in the first place.
