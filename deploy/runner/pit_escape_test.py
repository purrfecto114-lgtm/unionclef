"""Can the bot climb out of a pit toward an up-and-offset goal? A CORE-fix regression test.

Live on the survival stand 2026-09-10 the @gamer bot dug/fell into a shaft and stood at the
bottom for 3 minutes: its goal (a log) was UP and to the SIDE, and the task-driven navigator's
pillar recovery only fired when the goal was nearly straight overhead (horizToGoal < 1.5), so it
yielded forever. The fix (CustomTungstenGoalTask.pillarEscapeY) pillars out of a shaft whose wall
in the goal's direction is >= 2 tall. This test reproduces the shaft deterministically and asserts
the bot leaves it.

    python3 deploy/runner/pit_escape_test.py            # exit 0 = PASS

Builds a 1-wide, ~7-deep stone shaft on the FLAT nav server, drops the bot in with a stack of
dirt, sets an @goto to a point on the surface a few blocks to the side, and checks the bot's Y
rises out of the shaft within the window. Needs uctest-server + uctest-mc-tester1 up.
