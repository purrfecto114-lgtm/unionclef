/**
 * WindMouse-based rotation smoother for human-like yaw/pitch movement.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   1. Game tick — setTarget(yaw, pitch): store desired facing.
 *   2. Render frame — applyRenderStep(player): compute WindMouse delta, convert to
 *      raw pixel deltas, accumulate in pendingPixelDX/DY.
 *   3. MixinMouse.updateMouse(HEAD) — consume pixel deltas, add to cursorDeltaX/Y.
 *      Vanilla pipeline does the rest: sensitivity scaling → changeLookDirection.
 *
 * Result: rotation goes through the full vanilla mouse pipeline.
 * Server sees rotation steps identical to a physical mouse.
 *
 * LAZY nav turn (user request, 2026-10-04): navigation also has a LAZY mode
 * ({@code setTargetLazy}) — an ease-out glide ported from 23william90/baritone-26.3's
 * "legit camera movement" ({@code LookBehavior.handleLegitPlayerUpdate}, GitHub), driven
 * by {@link LazyLookPolicy}. It replaces the fast nav turn for ROUTE walking (short legs
 * and bends don't need a whip pan), while chases and mechanical contact (ladders) keep
 * {@code setTargetFast}. See LazyLookPolicy for the ported formula.
 *
 * TODO: large-angle mouse lift pauses — when a big turn requires "picking up the mouse",
 *       add a brief pause + reduced precision to simulate repositioning.
 *
 * Singleton: WindMouseRotation.INSTANCE — shared across all tasks.
