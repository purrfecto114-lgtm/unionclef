     * The allround figures cited in the next paragraph are n=2 an arm on the course that was later

     * <pre>
     *   edge_duel, n=11 an arm, arms interleaved, starved runs excluded
     *     bot carries it, victim on the baseline   margins -7 -5 -2 0 -10 +2 -4 -2 -4 -6 -4  mean -3.82
     *     neither side carries it (the mirror)     margins  0 +2 -5 +1  +1 -1 +1 +4  0 -3 +1  mean +0.09
     * </pre>
     * 3.2 sigma, and the mirror's +0.09 is the structural zero that makes the other column readable.
     * On melee_basic, whose spread is 0.75 and which would show a shift that size at more than five
     * standard errors, the same comparison reads median 0 over n=7. So this setting is NEUTRAL on
     * open ground and expensive where a retreat is impossible — see the stand-off note in
     * {@code CombatController}, which now refuses the band change when {@code dirSafe(back)} is
     * false, and which is itself NOT yet proven.
     *
     * <p>ON since 2026-08-02, proved on the ASYMMETRIC course because melee_basic is a MIRROR duel — both fighters
     * are this same jar with the same kit — so shipping a combat change on by default hands it to
     * the opponent too and the course stays a coin flip. The only way this stand can prove the
     * change is worth anything is `run_suite.py --pin combatReachControl=true`, which applies to
     * ONE of the two fighters. Measured that way on the asymmetric course (allround), interleaved:
     * deaths 1 and 1 with it against 2 and 3 without.
     *
     * <p>It also carries this module's ONLY health awareness — below half a bar the bot breaks
     * contact instead of trading (see {@code CombatController.LOW_HP}). Before it, getHealth() was
     * read nowhere in tungsten at all.
     *
     * <p>⛔ THAT RETREAT IS NO LONGER UNCONDITIONAL, 2026-08-10. It now also requires a launcher
     * and ammunition ({@code WeaponSelector.hasRangedOption}), because its whole justification is
     * that out past reach the bow becomes the weapon — and on a sword-only kit there is no bow, so
     * the bot walked out of range, dealt nothing, could not heal, and handed over the initiative.
     *
     * <p>Note what that means for reading THIS setting's measurements: the victim in the pvp duels
     * is pinned to {@code combatReachControl=false}, so it never entered this block and never had
     * the retreat. The bot did. Every "the bot loses a symmetric duel" figure recorded before that
     * date was therefore taken with a handicap on ONE side that no longer exists — including the
     * "4:4, 4:6, 4:4, 3:4, margin -0.75" series in CombatController and the verdict above it that
     * distance tuning is exhausted. Re-measure before trusting either.

     * mob_skeleton -- it cut the skeleton hit rate from 57% to 18%, and after its heading was given

     * intervals between our own swings run 19-22 ticks when contact holds and 90-123 when it does
     * not, against a 12-tick cooldown.
     *
     * <p>So the dodge is buying misses with swings. This declines the sidestep on the ticks where

     * ran. This is the first test of the idea with a dodge that actually reaches the keys.

     * y=-63 at 6.6 s, then {@code BFS stuck at 0,-63,0} with all eight neighbours

     * the only direction the search can expand is UP -- and the bot has just mined the blocks that
     * make pillaring affordable. It towers out to y=-55, six blocks above the floor, spending the
     * whole haul, and the run ends with it standing on a cobblestone column with an empty pack.

     * on all four cardinals at its own feet level. On open ground digging down stays ordinary, which
     * is what mine_diamond needs. In a pit, the blocks at feet level are the pit WALLS -- mine one
     * of those and you can step out. Stateless, so it releases the moment the bot is not enclosed,
     * and it cannot ratchet because it is a question about the world rather than about the bot.

     *   pooled n=10 an arm       off 3.60              on 5.50         +1.90   1.16 sigma
     * </pre>
     *
     * Both pairs interleaved, one invocation each, 25-29 fps throughout. The winner follows the
     * POSITION rather than the flag -- whichever arm ran second scored better -- which is the exact
     * failure rule 4q exists to catch, and it caught a default flip I had already made on pair 1.
     *
     * <p>What that does and does not say. The SHAFT is not in doubt: three traces show the bot
     * walling itself into a 1x1 hole and towering out of it on its own haul, and this rule provably
     * stops that. What is not established is that stopping it moves this course, and the arm still
     * fails half its runs (1, 0, 3, 3) -- so something else dominates, and until that is found the

     * <h2>IT IS THE PLAYTHROUGH'S WALL, MEASURED ON THE REAL WORLD (2026-08-14)</h2>
     *
     * Filed this morning as "correct by inspection, never exercised" -- mine_stone's arena barely
     * triggers it. A 14-minute @gamer window on the survival world says otherwise:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   breakFail=2/0/0/0        TWO failed breaks believed to be claims
     *   cb=90/842176/5318/103    cbAvoid -- 842,176 candidates refused

     * </pre>
     *
     * The ladder climbs five rungs in 5.5 minutes -- wood, first craft, crafting, wood tools, stone
     * tools -- and then stalls for 160 seconds of DAYLIGHT on
     * {@code Gathering resource: [minecraft:coal] -> Mine And Collect: [[coal]]} with every drive
     * counter at zero: pdEnter+0, dbTick+0, mqStart+0. Nothing is running because nothing is
     * allowed to be mined. Two break failures banned two 101x101x101 cubes and took the coal with
     * them.
     *
     * <h2>UNPARKED AND SHIPPED ON, WITH THE RISK MEASURED AND THE BENEFIT STILL OPEN (2026-08-14)</h2>
     *
     * <pre>
     *   craft: mine_stone, craft_stone_pickaxe, smelt_iron                 3/3 PASS
     *   nav:   flat staircase descend break wall2 bridge                   6/6 PASS
     *   both flags pinned ON, 27.0-29.5 fps throughout, 0 invalid
     * </pre>
     *
     * It was parked because the ON default had never been regression-tested. It has been now, and
     * the courses that matter most are in it: nav_break MINES and then continues, nav_wall2 and
     * nav_bridge BUILD.
     *
     * <p>WHAT IS STILL NOT PROVEN, said plainly: that the LADDER moves. The benefit rests on a
     * counter chain on the real world -- two failed breaks, 842,176 candidates refused, the coal
     * rung starving for 160 seconds of daylight -- and not on a measured ladder improvement, because
     * the survival client cannot start below 12 fps and the box is held by another project. The
     * next quiet window must confirm the ladder passes stone tools. If it does not, this comes back
     * off.
     *
     * <p>And no bench here has real land claims, so the anti-grief half is argued rather than
     * measured: on protected land every attempt is refused, so three distinct positions fail within
     * seconds and the regional ban installs itself as before.
     *
     * <h2>The original park, kept because the reasoning stands (2026-08-14)</h2>
     *
     * It was flipped ON to measure exactly that, and the confirming window came back
     * {@code INVALID - client at 8 fps before the run even starts (< 12.0)}: another project's
     * containers were taking ~750% of this box (one streamer at 431%, another at 222%, four MC
     * servers besides). That is rule ZERO, and the guard did its job by refusing to produce a
     * number rather than producing a bad one.
     *
     * <p>So the ON default has never been regression-tested -- the 11/12 craft sweep and the 6/6 nav
     * sweep both ran with it OFF -- and rule ZERO's mirror says a behaviour change that cannot be
     * measured today does not ship today. Parked here with its patch, its blast radius and its
     * reason, which is what that rule asks for.
     *
     * <p>Blast radius if turned on: every break refusal anywhere, on every course and in the
     * playthrough. It NARROWS a ban, so the risk is under-banning on genuinely protected land, and
     * the escalation to the old radius after three distinct refusals is what bounds that.
     *
     * <p>To take it off the shelf: check {@code docker stats} is quiet, then run the craft sweep and
     * a @gamer window with it pinned true. Mechanism gate: cbAvoid, which reads 260992 on a run this fires in and
     * must collapse to near zero -- an effect size the gate metric cannot come close to, which is
     * the point after two series died on that gate's sd of 3.6.

     * wanderDenied=0 in the FIX arm -- the branch never fired, so they cannot say anything about
     * the flag, and that includes the -3. Restricted to the three pairs where it did fire the

     * </pre>

     * <p>⛔ AND ITS GATE WAS ONE SUITE SHORT. The gate above names nav, craft and playthrough

     *   narrow_bridge_duel  guard ON 0/2     guard OFF 1/2

     * process rather than this flag: a gate written before the measurement did not think of duels
     * over void, and the next flag gets all four suites regardless of what its gate names.
     *

     * <h2>RE-TESTED 2026-08-27 -- THE OLD VERDICT USED A METRIC THAT HIDES THIS</h2>
     *
     * <p>The n=8 neutral above was scored by RUNGS. The operator then watched a recording
     * and pointed out what rungs cannot show: rungs banked before a death stay on the
     * scoreboard, so a run that dies halfway still reads as a success. Dead time
     * (deploy/runner/deadtime.py) replaced it as the primary measure.
     *
     * <p>Under the new measure the case for this flag is far stronger than it was. Polling
     * the live task chain every five seconds through the post-stone-tools window:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   98.7%  77 samples  Getting to block {x=1449, y=63, z=89}
     *    1.3%   1 sample   (none)
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>And that block is a spruce_log -- a solid trunk. GetToBlockTask asks to OCCUPY the
     * cell, which cannot happen while the log stands, so the bot spends seven minutes of a
     * ten-minute run on one unreachable goal. The ladder's hard five-rung ceiling is this.
     *
     * <h3>RE-TEST RESULT: DEAD TIME BETTER, LADDER WORSE AND WILDER -- STAYS OFF</h3>
     *
     * <pre>
     *              dead time            rungs
     *   ON    0 27 15 4 14 -> med 14%   6 4 2 0 5 -> med 4

     * <p>One run DID break the five-rung ceiling (six rungs, coal at 246.7 s), which no run
     * on the other build managed. But one of five is an observation, not a result, and the
     * ladder median fell from 5 to 4 while its spread went from 3-5 to 0-6.
     *
     * <p>So the diagnosis holds -- 98.7% of the post-stone-tools window really is spent on
     * one unreachable occupancy goal -- but this cure trades a steady ladder for an erratic
     * one. Off again. What it argues for is fixing the OCCUPANCY GOAL AT ITS SOURCE for

     *
     * IDLE is 7 ticks of 2882 and 5 of 2264 -- two tenths of one per cent. Something is running
     * essentially always, so "nobody drives the body" is FALSE, and that assumption is what the
     * camera yield, the lock drop, the walker yield and the give-up retry were all built on.
     *
     * <p>And the body MOVES on 41% and 31% of lock ticks. A barren lock is not a freeze. It is
     * motion that nets to zero -- which is exactly what the operator described from a recording
     * ("the bot twitches back and forth") and what {@code m0.0} in the barren geometry means: 41%
     * of ticks spent moving, ending where it started.
     *
     * <p>The search is active on 58-60% of those ticks, which is what continuous replanning looks
     * like. And the lock branch replans every {@code RETARGET_INTERVAL_MS} = 3 s, so a

     *
     *
     * <p>The verdict above shipped this ON after two pairs. A six-run sweep says that was
     * premature:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   pair 1   fix  lockRetarget 4/5   NOTHING reached (FAIL)  |  control 12/0  stone@89.2s
     *   pair 2   fix  lockRetarget 7/4   stone@21.5s             |  control 22/0  stone@313.5s
     *   pair 3   fix  lockRetarget 0/0   no stone tools          |  control 26/0  stone@426.8s
     * </pre>
     *
     * Pair 3 is void for this flag by rule 4a1 -- it never fired. Of the rest, stone tools were
     * reached by the fixed arm ONCE in three and by the control THREE times in three. Adding the
     * earlier sweep gives 3 of 5 against 4 of 5: a wash, or slightly against.
     *
     * <p>The fastest run of everything measured today is still a fixed one (21.5 s), and the gate
     * stays green -- craft 14/14, chases untouched by construction. So this neither helps nor
     * harms, measurably, and "principled" is not the same as "demonstrated". It goes OFF, and the
     * two pairs that convinced me stay written down next to the four that did not.
     *
     * <p>Shipping on two pairs of a course this repository has already measured at sevenfold spread
     * was the error, not the idea. The bar is pairs where the mechanism FIRES on both arms, and

     * The stone toolset must not outrank ORE, which is what a flat priority against a
     * distance-scaled one guarantees today.
     *
     * <p>⛔ THE CEILING, AND IT IS ARITHMETIC. Two priorities of different KINDS are compared as if
     * they were the same number:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   ore        DistanceItemPriorityCalculator:  priority = (1 / distance) * 1050
     *   toolset    StaticItemPriorityCalculator:    priority = 520, flat
     * </pre>
     *
     * Measured on the bench: coal is visible on 841 of 847 samples and iron on 847 of 847, with the
     * NEAREST coal 2.5 blocks away and the nearest iron 4.6. Put those in:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   coal at 2.5 blocks   1050 / 2.5  =  420      loses to 520
     *   coal at 10 blocks    1050 / 10   =  105      loses to 520
     *   coal at 50 blocks    1050 / 50   =   21      loses to 520
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>For ore to win it must be closer than 1050/520 = 2.02 blocks. So the "priority 1050" ore
     * task, twice the toolset's number on paper, essentially never runs -- and the bot spends 69%
     * of every post-stone-tools run collecting a stone axe, sword, shovel and hoe it does not need,
     * with iron ore four blocks away.
     *
     * <p>That is the whole ceiling. It explains the 69%, it explains ore being visible and ignored,
     * and it explains why the ladder stops at stone tools in run after run.
     *
     * <p>THE FIX IS NOT A BIGGER NUMBER FOR ORE. Scaling ore up keeps the two kinds incomparable
     * and just moves the crossover. The toolset is a CONVENIENCE and ore is PROGRESSION, so the
     * convenience yields whenever progression is actually available: the toolset's flat priority
     * drops to a value ore beats at a working radius. At 150, ore wins out to 7 blocks; at 60, out
     * to 17.
     *
     * <p>Read the post-rung task share, which is the number this is aimed at: 69% stone_axe today.
     * GATE: playthrough for the ladder, then craft -- the toolset lives there.
     *
     * <h2>MEASURED: IT REDIRECTS THE BOT EXACTLY AS INTENDED (2026-08-24)</h2>
     *
     * <p>The number this was aimed at is the share of post-rung samples spent on the toolset. The
     * historical baseline, over 25 runs, is 69% stone_axe. With the fix, in the one run of the
     * paired sweep that produced enough post-rung samples to read:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   run 3 (fix)   after stone tools:  stone_axe 0%,  COAL 80%  (8 of 10 samples)
     * </pre>
     *
     * The bot stopped collecting a stone hoe and went mining coal, which is the next rung. That is
     * the mechanism doing precisely what the arithmetic predicted once the flat 520 stopped
     * outranking (1 / distance) * 1050.
     *
     * <p>Ladder, two pairs: 4 rungs against 3, and 5 against 4 -- the fixed arm ahead in both, and
     * neither arm past stone tools inside a 14-minute run. Reaching stone tools at 156 s leaves
     * about ten minutes to smelt and mine, so the rung not moving here says little; the task share
     * says a great deal.
     *
     * <p>The other three runs produced 0, 9 and 1 post-rung samples, which is too few to read. That
     * is the honest limit of this measurement: one run's worth of evidence for the redirection,
     * and it agrees with the arithmetic exactly.

     * <p>The diagnosis behind it still stands and is worth someone's time: the bot really
     * does wall itself in (BFS: every neighbour feetBlocked=dirt, the only opening a
     * corner-cut diagonal) and really does stand there for 95% of a run. What is needed is
     * a test that separates DIGGING from STRANDED -- for instance, requiring that no block

     *

     * <p>So this rescue IS the shuttle: it seizes the bot, shimmies, releases, the bot walks
     * back, and it seizes again. The three-number picture is an honest trade rather than an
     * improvement -- ON gives 8-23% dead time with shuttling; OFF gives 40-64% dead time
     * with a shuttle ratio of 0.83 and none detected. Rungs sit at 4-5 either way.
     *
     * <p>The operator has already judged that trade: a shuttle is worse than standing still,

     * <p>The creeper-flee half of the trigger does not have this problem as far as anything on

     * <p>This also explains three sub-threshold {@link #combatEngageBand} series (+0.83, +0.88 at

         *   nav 13/14, nav_water FAIL   (rescue ahead of the water branch -- fixed by moving it)
         *   nav_gaps INVALID: the bot LEFT THE ARENA, min Y -151.8 against a floor at -60

         *
         * <p>The premise was 'the bot is physically supported where it stands, so a NaN support is
         * the world query being wrong'. It is not. On land a NaN support means the bot is NOT
         * standing -- it is airborne, mid-fall, or over a hole. Faking support at its own level
         * makes the planner build a GROUND route from mid-air, and the bot walks into the void.
         * That is what nav_gaps measured.
         *
         * <p>The measurement that motivated it still stands and is now better read:
         * plan=95/.../zero57(e0=0,e1=57) does not mean the planner wrongly refuses the start -- it
         * means SIXTY PER CENT OF PLANS ARE REQUESTED WHILE THE BOT IS UNSUPPORTED, and they fail
         * correctly. The fix is not to fake support but to resolve the start to the cell the bot is
         * about to LAND on (BlockSpacePathFinder.resolveStart already does exactly that), or to
         * withhold the plan until it is grounded.
         *
         * <p>CONFIRMED TWICE, INDEPENDENTLY. Moving the rescue behind the water/ladder branch did
         * NOT save it: nav_water failed again. So the rescue also fires on swimming starts that
         * isWater() does not classify as water, which is the same mistake in another guise --
         * a NaN support means NOT STANDING, and swimming is one of the ways to not be standing.
         *
         * <p>Also corrected: the nav_gaps 'left the arena' INVALID was NOT caused by this flag. It
         * reproduces with the flag OFF, and the suite itself re-measures it on fresh clients and

     * operator's complaint -- "stared at one point and stood still".
     *
     * <p>The exhausted exit has had this fallback since #67 and it never fired: the local it reads

     * today's behaviour exactly.
     *
     * <p>GATE: paired A/B on the playthrough (gamer_smoke --pin-alt), scored on DEAD TIME rather
     * than rungs (rule 4a2). Read bsClosestUsed for proof it fired -- it must be 0 in the control
     * arm and non-zero in the fix arm, or the pair measured nothing (rule 4a1). bsStub /
     * bsStubHadCloser / bsStubCloserCm say how much material exists either way.

     * Let a goal task finish when the bot stands where the SNAP put its goal, not only where the
     * task literally asked.
     *
     * <p>CustomBaritoneGoalTask.driveTungstenPrimary steers at snapGoalToStandable(goal), and that
     * snap only moves a goal that CANNOT BE STOOD IN. isFinished() meanwhile asks
     * AltoGoal.Block.reached, which demands the bot OCCUPY the requested cell. So for every goal
     * the snap has to move, arrival is unsatisfiable by construction -- the drive parks the bot
     * beside the block, the task says "not there", and asks again every tick. Measured on the
     * playthrough:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   snap=200/197/3/self134[GetToBlockTaskx134]
     *   atGoal=10(ex10,ytol0)@GetToBlockTask@block(-311,125,-257)x10
     *   snap=944/809/135/self747      (earlier run, 79% of asks)
     *   plan=98/../zero61(atGoal=61(ex61,ytol0))
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>The goal moved on 197 of 200 asks and landed on the BOT 134 times, and snapToSelf counts
     * only ticks where isFinished() had already returned false. This is TODOS profile A -- "a route
     * into the cell the bot already stands in", open since 2026-08-26 with "put a counter on the
     * goal source" as its next move. The counter now names the source: GetToBlockTask, one block,
     * over and over.
     *
     * <p>Accepting the snapped cell can only ADD completions that were otherwise impossible: an
     * unstandable cell cannot be occupied, so the exact test could never have passed there. A goal
     * that stood on its own is untouched.
     *
     * <p>THE RISK TO WATCH: a caller that needed occupancy, or one that re-issues the approach the
     * moment it finds itself out of reach -- that would turn a freeze into a shuttle, which the
     * playthrough already measures (deploy/runner/shuttle.py). Score dead time AND shuttling.
     *
     * <p>GATE: paired gamer_smoke --pin-alt on dead time (rule 4a2). Read arrivedAtSnap for proof
     * it fired -- 0 in control, non-zero in fix, or the pair measured nothing (rule 4a1).
