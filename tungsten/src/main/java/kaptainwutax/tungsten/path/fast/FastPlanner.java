/**
 * A fast, honest block-space planner: baritone-class A* over cells, built so the
 * bot can START WALKING almost immediately while the physics engine keeps
 * working on the hard parts.
 *
 * WHY A NEW PLANNER. The existing block search generated neighbours by scanning
 * a blind radius-8 sphere (hundreds of candidates per expansion), never
 * accumulated a path cost (g(n) was a constant, so it was greedy best-first and
 * every move cost was dead), and judged passability by XZ area. That is slow AND
 * wrong; measured on the stand it dropped the client to 1-6 fps while searching.
 * This planner:
 *   - expands a FIXED move set (traverse, diagonal, ascend, descend, parkour),
 *     so an expansion is ~14 candidates instead of ~2000;
 *   - accumulates real g-cost with an admissible octile heuristic (the baritone
 *     coefficient 3.563, just under sprint speed, so A* stays optimal);
 *   - uses an array binary heap + an open-addressing long map: no per-edge
 *     allocation, O(1) membership, O(log n) decrease-key;
 *   - asks {@link PlayerFit} whether the body actually fits, so a plan is
 *     physically executable (no slab-capped 1.5-block passages);
 *   - is time-sliced and always returns the best chain it found, so movement can
 *     start on a partial plan.
 *
 * Moves that vanilla walking cannot execute (gap jumps) are flagged
 * {@code needsPhysics} on the resulting waypoint, so the caller can hand exactly
 * those segments to the physics engine instead of walking into them — that is
 * how parkour keeps working while the rest of the route runs at walker speed.
