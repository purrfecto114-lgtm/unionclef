/**
 * Port of {@code baritone/src/main/java/baritone/pathing/movement/Movement.java} (1-296), the
 * abstract base of one one-block step: it prices itself once, breaks what is in the way before it
 * runs ({@link #prepared}), and is the SINGLE per-tick writer of keys and of the camera target
 * ({@link #update}). Verified line-by-line against {@code shredder/.../pathing/movement/Movement.java},
 * which is the same file already compiling on this MC version — that is where {@code getEntityPos()}
 * (vs upstream's {@code getPos()}) comes from.
 *
 * <p>Why the "release everything, then press exactly what this tick declared, then clear the map"
 * order is load-bearing (Movement.java:139-143): a key not set this tick is released this tick, so
 * nothing latches. That is what makes "one owner of the inputs" true rather than aspirational, and
 * it is the fix for measured pitfall P1 (BARITONE-PORT-SPEC.md: {@code called=11041 inRange=11040
 * clicked=0} — a second per-tick writer racing this one). Whatever ticks a Movement MUST therefore
 * suppress every other input/aim writer for that tick (BlockPathWalker, PathExecutor, combat).
 *
 * <h2>Adapters written here because tungsten has no baritone service</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code IPlayerContext} -&gt; {@link PlayerCtx}, a nested adapter with only the members the
 *       movements use. {@code playerFeet}/{@code playerHead} are ported verbatim
 *       (IPlayerContext.java:62-95) including the {@code +0.1251} and the slab correction;
 *       {@code objectMouseOver} is a LIVE raytrace, per BaritonePlayerContext.java:84-86 — never
 *       {@code mc.crosshairTarget}, which at the stand's measured 10 fps is one to two ticks stale,
 *       exactly the width of the sneak-pose and jump-apex windows.</li>
 *   <li>{@code LookBehavior.updateTarget(rot, force)} -&gt; {@link WindMouseRotation}: forced
 *       targets go to {@code setTarget}, unforced ({@code moveTowards}) to {@code setTargetFast}
 *       with the pitch preserved. The camera is NEVER moved with {@code setYaw}/{@code setPitch} —
 *       rotation has to go through the vanilla mouse pipeline or it is trivially detectable.</li>
 *   <li>{@code InputOverrideHandler} -&gt; {@link #clearAllKeys()} / {@link #applyInputs} over
 *       {@code MinecraftClient.getInstance().options}, including the
 *       CLICK_LEFT-cancels-CLICK_RIGHT interlock (InputOverrideHandler.java:94-96) and the
 *       {@code BlockPlaceHelper} 4-tick right-click gate (BlockPlaceHelper.java:29-57).</li>
 *   <li>{@code MovementHelper.switchToBestToolFor} -&gt; {@code TungstenModDataContainer.equipToolHook}
 *       (TungstenModDataContainer.java:30). Tungsten never touches the inventory itself; altoclef
 *       owns the hotbar, so baritone's {@code ToolSet} is not ported.</li>
 *   <li>{@code CalculationContext} -&gt; {@code (WorldView, ClientPlayerEntity)} per the spec's
 *       substitution table. {@code Baritone.settings()} -&gt; hardcoded upstream defaults, each
 *       named at its use site.</li>
 *   <li>{@code PathingBehavior.pathStart()} — no equivalent; see {@link #playerInValidPosition()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What this file expects from the rest of the package (unit 1 contract)</h2>

     *   MV 13,-60,0-&gt;14,-60,0 pos=13.20 yaw=81/-91  err=-171 keys=F   &lt;- ...runs the bot BACKWARDS

     * At 25 fps the turn costs half a block and the course still passes; at the ~9 fps of a full
     * sweep it costs three, the queue gives up, and the bot ends in the void — final_dist 22.5,
     * self_falls=1.
     *
     * <p>MEASURED AND REVERTED, so it is not tried again: holding the direction keys back until the
     * CAMERA reached a forced target changed nothing (22.5 before, 22.5 after, avg_fps 8.8 both).
     * The branch that walks the bot backwards is the {@code MovementHelper.moveTowards} fall-through,
     * whose target is UNFORCED, so the gate never saw it — and widening the gate to every target
