/**
 * Keeps the bot walking at a committed target on the ticks where nothing else does.
 *
 * <h2>The defect, measured in blocks rather than ticks</h2>
 *
 * During re-approach -- beyond reach, after the bot has already been in contact once -- 47% of
 * ticks reach the game with NO movement key pressed at all. On those ticks {@code Nav.isPathing()}
 * is true through {@code PATHFINDER.active}, i.e. the search is running, while the walker, the
 * movement queue and the physics executor are all off. Nothing is driving, because the path that
 * would drive is being computed.
 *
 * <p>Counting those ticks made them look negligible: 15% of an engagement, median window one tick.
 * Counting BLOCKS says the opposite, because of what the margin is:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     clean sprint tick    0.244 b/t     net vs a retreating skeleton (0.215)   +0.029
 *     idle tick            0.067 b/t     net                                    -0.148
 * </pre>
 *
 * An idle tick loses five times what a sprint tick gains. At 47% idle the average is 0.160 b/t,
 * BELOW the target's retreat, so the bot loses ground on average and settles at the ~5-block
 * equilibrium the distance histogram shows. At 0% idle the average is 0.244 and it gains. A
 * one-tick key release is not one tick of lost progress; it is about five.
 *
 * <h2>Why a latch and not the combat controller</h2>
 *
 * Handing these ticks to {@code closeQuarters} was tried -- {@code combatCloseOwnsBand} -- and
 * measured WORSE: reachMean 3.53 -> 4.71, inReachRate 0.375 -> 0.143. That controller orbits, holds
 * a strike band and backs off, which is right in contact and wrong while closing. This presses
 * exactly one thing, forward, and only when the tick would otherwise be empty:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>no band, no strafe, no back-off, no jump -- it cannot fight the controller because it never
 *       runs on a tick the controller drove;</li>
 *   <li>only while the defence chain is COMMITTED to a kill (it stamps this class from the branch
 *       that returns 65), and only for a couple of ticks after that stamp, so it dies with the
 *       fight rather than lingering;</li>
 *   <li>only beyond {@link TriggerBot#REACH}: inside reach the swing and the spacing matter more
 *       than another step, and that zone already has an owner.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Direction, not facing</h2>
 *
 * The heading is converted into the player's own frame and pressed as forward/back/left/right, the
 * same way {@link kaptainwutax.tungsten.task.ProjectileDodge} does, so this never touches the
 * camera and works regardless of where the head is pointing. Pressing a bare "forward" would walk
 * whichever way the crosshair happened to be, and the aim is owned by a different subsystem.
