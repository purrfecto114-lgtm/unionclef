        // whole point of hopping is to make crits the normal case.
        // Solving (1 - cd) * 12.5 > 6 gives cd < 0.52: take off then, and the swing arrives on the
        // way down. The lower bound keeps the bot from hopping the instant it has swung, when the
        // next swing is still most of a second away.
        // ⛔ SUPPRESSING THE RANDOM JUKE TO "PROTECT" THE CRIT HOP IS REFUTED. TRIED AND REVERTED.
        //
        // The reasoning looked sound: a swing cycle is 12.5 ticks, a jump holds the bot off the
        // ground for about 600 ms of it, and the crit take-off window (cd 0.25-0.50) is ticks 3-6 --
        // so a juke launched just after a swing leaves the bot airborne exactly when it needs to
        // take off, and it lands flat-footed. Making the crit window the ONLY hop should have made
        // crits reliable.
        //
        // It did the opposite, n=8 an arm on mob_skeleton:
        //     random juke kept    critWindowSwings 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0   crits mean 1.0   1/8 PASS
        //     juke suppressed     critWindowSwings 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0   crits mean 0.5   0/8 PASS
        //
        // So the juke was not stealing the take-off, it was PROVIDING it: with only 2-4 swings in a
        // fight, the crit window is missed for reasons of its own (not grounded, edge score, landing
        // check) and the random hop was the thing that happened to put the bot in a descent often
        // enough to matter. Remove it and the accidental crits go with it.
        //
        // The lesson for whoever times this next: crits here are not a cadence problem. Find out
