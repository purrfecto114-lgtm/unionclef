/**
 * A movement request for one combat tick — what a subsystem WANTS the legs to do,
 * separated from actually pressing the keys.
 *
 * <p>WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-27). Combat movement used to be written straight to
 * {@code mc.options.*Key.setPressed(...)} by two independent subsystems at two different
 * frequencies: {@link SafetySystem#renderUpdate} (the stage machine + BFS attack-path
 * follower) ran once per RENDER FRAME, while {@code CombatController.combatMove} ran once
 * per CLIENT TICK. Whichever happened to run last before vanilla sampled the keyboard won,
 * so the bot's movement depended on the framerate — which is exactly why behaviour on the
 * low-FPS test stand never matched behaviour on the user's machine. On top of that, the
 * per-tick writer bypassed the {@link VoidGuard} clamp entirely, and the correct
 * eye-to-hitbox approach distance implemented in the stage machine was being overwritten
 * by a cruder centre-to-centre rule in the per-tick writer.
 *
 * <p>Now every producer fills an intent, {@code CombatController} resolves them by priority
 * once per tick, {@link VoidGuard} vetoes the result, and the keys are written EXACTLY ONCE.
