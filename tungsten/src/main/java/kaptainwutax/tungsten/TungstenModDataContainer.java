     * ACTIVE. The audit of 2026-10-03 was misled by the same stale sentence. The measured
     * history that motivated the flag is kept for context:
     *
     * <p>Measured on the playthrough, 2026-08-18: the bot descends from y=134 to y=60 and takes
     * 25.3 damage, of which the damage witness attributes FOUR events out of four to no living
     * entity at all -- dw=4/25.3/27.08/30.05/4/1, and unattributedHits is documented as "falls,
     * void, fire". One run reached wood tools and spent its last 150 seconds chipping stone on
     * 1.5 hp; the next reached no rung at all.
     *
     * <p>WHY NO COURSE CAUGHT IT: nav_descend offers drops of 1, 2 and 3 blocks. Every one of them
     * is under the 2.75 threshold, so the course is green whether the guard runs or not. A course
     * that only offers safe drops cannot test the guard against unsafe ones -- the same blind spot
     * as a course that hands the bot a weapon already in its hand.
     *
     * <p>Flagged rather than flipped, so the two arms can be interleaved: pathAvoidsFallDamage=true
     * turns the guard ON, which is now the shipped default.
