/**
 * The one place altoclef talks to a pathfinder.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * G-0 is "stop depending on baritone", and after the goal TYPE (see {@link AltoGoal}) the second
 * thing holding the two together is the ENGINE, reached through {@code mod.getClientBaritone()}.
 * Counted across src/main that is about sixty calls in thirty files, and almost all of them say one
 * of four things: stop navigating, are we navigating, is it safe to interrupt, go here.
 *
 * <p>Scattered like that the dependency cannot be removed — every task would have to be edited on
 * the day the engine changes. Behind this facade it can: the tasks state intent, and WHICH engine
 * serves it is decided here, in one file. When the legacy half goes, it goes from this file only.
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * It does not change behaviour. Each method does exactly what the call sites do today, including
 * which engine they address — a sweep that quietly alters semantics cannot be measured, and the
 * cancel calls in particular are load-bearing in ways that need their own pass (today
 * {@link #cancel()} stops the legacy engine and leaves a tungsten walk running, because that is
 * what the call sites currently do; the stuck-handler in CustomTungstenGoalTask calls it every time
 * the progress checker trips, and stopping tungsten there would abort a healthy leg).
 *
 * <p>It is null-safe throughout, which the raw calls were not: {@code getClientBaritone()} returns
 * null when the engine did not initialise, and a task that cancels pathing on that path threw.

     * <h2>Why this is a second method and not a stronger {@link #cancel()}</h2>
     *
     * They answer different questions, and this file's own header says so: {@code cancel()} means
     * "abandon this attempt" and is called by the stuck-handler every time the progress checker
     * trips, so tearing tungsten down inside it would abort a healthy leg. This one means "there is
     * nothing left to walk to", which is true in exactly two places -- the user cancelled
     * everything, or the task finished and the runner was switched off.
     *
     * <h2>What it was for</h2>
     *
     * A search in flight outlives the task that asked for it. Traced on mine_stone: the task ended
     * at 29.5 s with its eight cobblestone gathered, and two seconds later a route arrived --
     * {@code MovementQueue: 8 movement(s) 0,-63,0 -> 0,-55,0} -- and the bot spent every block it
     * had just mined building a tower out of its own pit. It then stood on top of that tower for
     * the remaining 84 seconds, with an empty pack, while the course read the pack.
     *
     * <p>Neither existing stop covered it. {@code AltoClef.stopTasks()} cancels the CHAIN and never
     * speaks to tungsten at all, and tungsten's own {@code ;stop} is a separate command the bot
     * never issues to itself. So between "the job is done" and "something is walking me" there was
     * no connection in either direction.
     *
     * <h2>Deliberately navigation only</h2>
     *
     * {@code TungstenMod.resetAllState()} exists and is the hard reset -- but it also stops the
     * punk task, the bow and the aim, and clears every key. That is right on a disconnect and wrong
     * here: the agent drives tungsten primitives DIRECTLY over py4j (that is the whole design), so
     * an altoclef task ending must not silently kill a shot the agent lined up. What ends when the
     * goal ends is the route: the navigator (which cascades to the movement queue), the waypoint
     * walker, the physics search and its executor, and the two building manoeuvres that only ever
     * exist to serve a route.

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code lock} -- {@code TungstenHelper.isLocked()}, which is deliberately true BETWEEN

     *
     * <p>⛔ SAMPLED AT THE DENIAL, NOT AT THE CALL. Nav's earlier {@link #navSearchOnly} counts
     * ticks on which somebody happened to CALL {@code isExecutingRoute}, which makes it a tally of
     * a code path rather than of the state -- the same blinding that made four counters in this

     * DOES THE BOT EVER SEE ORE? The one link missing from the ceiling chain, and it decides

     * <p>Measured: after stone tools the bot spends 97.4% of its samples above Y=60 (862 positions
     * over 29 runs, median Y 82), and the ore tasks -- priority 1050, twice the stone toolset's 520

     *
     * <p>The convenient reading is "it never goes underground". That may be wrong: since 1.18 coal
     * generates high as well, peaking near Y=95, and iron has a second band up there too. At a
     * median of Y=82 there could be coal within a few blocks. So:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>ore SEEN and near -> the scanner is fine and something else refuses the task;
     *   <li>ore seen but FAR -> it is a travel problem, not a descent problem;
     *   <li>ore never seen at all -> the bot really must go down and find caves.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Three different fixes, one counter. Read oreSeen=coalTicks/ironTicks/samples and
     * oreNear=coalDist/ironDist (nearest seen this run, -1 for never).
