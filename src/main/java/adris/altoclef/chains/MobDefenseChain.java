     *   4 / 5.62 / 6.28        4 / 79  / 20 / 7.30            11
     *   7 / 6.27 / 8.19        8 / 151 / 20 / 6.05            17
     *   20 / 9.45 / 12.30      21 / 409 / 20 / 9.25           16
     *   4 / 4.61 / 5.22        5 / 87  / 20 / 6.40             8
     *   2 / 4.30 / 5.42        3 / 45  / 20 / 7.57            16

     * </pre>
     * Draw count tracks arrow count, so EVERY shot is preceded by a draw. The longest draw is
     * exactly 20 ticks in all six runs — a full second, every time, not a lucky sample. And it
     * BEGINS at 6.0-9.3 blocks while the shot leaves at 4.3-6.3: the skeleton starts aiming while
     * the bot is still out, and the bot closes under an already-drawn bow.
     *
     * <p>So the reaction window is one second wide and starts at a comfortable range, against the
     * under-two-ticks a fired arrow allows. That is the difference between a dodge that cannot
     * work and one that can.
     */
    /**
     * EXPOSURE: ticks spent inside the band a shooter actually fires from.
     *
     * <p>Measured today and it is the quantity that decides this course, not fight length. A
     * skeleton releases only from 4.3-6.3 blocks and hits 50-70% there, against ~15% at ten. So
     * "shorter fight" and "less time under fire" are DIFFERENT numbers here, and they can move in
     * opposite directions: removing the circle-strafe cut wasted swing ticks by a third and made
     * arrows WORSE, because the orbit had been holding the bot at the band's edge.
     *
     * <p>Counted from 2.5 to 7.0 blocks — from inside our own reach out past the furthest release
     * seen — so the ratio arrows/bandTicks reads as "shots per tick of exposure" and separates the
     * two effects that have been confounded all day.
     *
     * <p>⛔ FIRST READING, 2026-08-12:
     * <pre>
     *   arrows n/mean/max     draws        band   min_hp
     *   3 / 4.53 / 5.73       3 / 60 / 20   146     17

     *   3 / 4.33 / 5.98       3 / 60 / 21   141     16
     *   4 / 6.63 / 10.42      5 / 85 / 20   169     16
     *   2 / 4.09 / 5.51       3 / 42 / 20   111     16
     *   6 / 8.49 / 14.91      7 / 121 / 22  179      9
     *   33 / 9.44 / 12.95     33 / 661 / 22 179      4   <- never closed; shot from ~9.4
     * </pre>
     * The bot spends 111-215 ticks — five and a half to eleven seconds — inside the band, and takes
     * 2-4 shots there: about 0.02 shots per tick of exposure, one every two and a half seconds,
     * which reconciles with a 20-tick draw plus aiming.
     *
     * <p>THAT IS THE TARGET, stated in a measurable quantity for the first time: not "kill faster"
     * and not "dodge", but TIME FROM ENTERING SEVEN BLOCKS TO THE KILL. Zero arrows landed needs
     * that cut by roughly two thirds — from ~150 ticks to ~50, i.e. down to a single shot — and
     * any change should be judged on band ticks first, arrows second.
     *
     * <p>⛔ HOW MUCH ROOM THERE IS, AND WHAT "GREEN" CAN EVEN MEAN HERE. From measured constants
     * only — vanilla sprint 5.6 blocks/s, an iron sword's 6 damage against 20 HP, a 0.625 s
     * cooldown:
     * <pre>
     *   closing 7.0 -> 3.0 at sprint        14 ticks
     *   four swings at 0.625 s              50 ticks
     *   THEORETICAL FLOOR                   64 ticks in band  -> ~1.3 shots
     *   measured                           111-215, median 169 -> ~3.4 shots
     * </pre>
     * There is enormous room — the bot spends 2.6x the floor, about five seconds of slack. But the
     * floor itself still costs ABOUT ONE SHOT, and a close shot lands 50-70% of the time.
     *
     * <p>So this gate, which demands ZERO arrows landed, is a COIN at roughly 40% even for perfect
     * execution, unless the bot also kills in three swings (one crit) or denies that last shot.
     * Worth knowing before another pass is spent expecting a deterministic green: a course whose
     * ceiling is a coin cannot be turned green by tuning alone, and the honest goal is to push the
     * pass rate toward that ceiling rather than to 12/12.
     *
     * <p>⛔ CORRECTION TO MY OWN FLOOR, from the crit rate rather than an assumption. Over 39 landed
     * swings today, 15 were crits — 38%. Three swings kill on ONE crit (9+6+6 = 21 against 20 HP),
     * and P(at least one crit in three) at that rate is 77%. So the four-swing kill I used for the
     * floor is the pessimistic case, not the normal one: the real floor is 14 + 37.5 = ~51 ticks,
     * about ONE shot, and the ceiling is correspondingly better than 40%.
     *
     * <p>AND A CLAIM OF MINE FROM AN HOUR AGO, WITHDRAWN BEFORE IT WAS BUILT ON. I wrote that the
     * bot is "already OVERKILLING" because landed=4 crits=1 computes to ~27 damage against a 20 HP
     * skeleton. That treats gateStats' `passed` as damaging hits, and it is not: it counts swings
     * that passed the GATE, i.e. attacks sent. Minecraft gives a mob ~10 ticks of invulnerability
     * after a hit, and mdTung is a PAIR — the committed fight AND the force field's strike — so
     * when both fire, one lands inside those frames and is absorbed. The damage line above says so
     * itself ("an estimate with a soft edge"), and I then quoted it as proof.
     *
     * <p>So there are two live readings and they need different fixes: the bot swings after the
     * kill is in (stop early, save a 12.5-tick cooldown inside the band), or two strikers are
     * hitting the same mob and half the swings are eaten by i-frames (make them one). The second
     * would ALSO explain why `landed` runs high while fights stay long.
     *
     * <p>TO SEPARATE THEM, and it is cheap: compare the target's health drop against swings sent.
     * Health is client-visible; the counter for it is one line next to the ones already here.

     * corr(band ticks, arrows) = +0.43 over 33 runs, read as "the controller is starved of band
     * ticks, give it more". The trivial reading was never excluded: a fight that takes longer has
     * both more band ticks AND more arrows, because the skeleton keeps shooting throughout. The
     * series then settled it -- the flag tripled controller ticks, band ticks went 122 -> 192, and

     * a correlation with a shared cause is what it looks like.
     *
     * <p>What the gate actually prices is time the skeleton shoots for free. A kill needs about
     * three swings at a ~12-tick cooldown, so the fight itself is ~36 ticks; anything beyond that

     * Count each incoming arrow ONCE, at the range it was fired from.
     *
     * <p>The tracker rebuilds its projectile list every tick from a world scan, so identity is
     * what separates "a new shot" from "the same arrow, one tick later" — hence
     * {@link CachedProjectile#entityId}. The first tick an arrow is visible is within a tick of
     * the release, so the gap between the bot and the arrow at that moment IS the range it was
     * shot from, without needing the shooter.
     *
     * <p>WHY IT MATTERS: dw already says where arrows LAND (3.79-5.03, max 6.30 — point blank).
     * It says nothing about the shots that missed. If the distant ones miss, the only lever left
     * is time inside the killing band; if the skeleton holds fire until close, closing faster buys
     * nothing at all. The two readings point at opposite fixes, and this is the counter that
     * separates them.
     *
     * <p>⛔ ANSWERED, 2026-08-12 — IT HOLDS FIRE. Six runs on the repaired course:
     * <pre>
     *   arrows fired (n/mean/max)   min_hp   landed
     *   2 / 5.56 / 5.58               20       0
     *   2 / 4.36 / 6.37               16       1
     *   3 / 5.56 / 6.15               13       2
     *   2 / 4.54 / 5.33               13       2
     *   3 / 5.43 / 8.48               15       1
     *   41 / 10.38 / 13.07             4       6    <- the bot never closed (mdFar 1979)
     * </pre>
     * A normal fight costs the bot 2-3 shots, ALL fired from 4.4-5.6 blocks, of which 1-2 land.
     * Nothing is fired at the approach, so every hypothesis about shortening time-under-fire while
     * closing was aimed at a phase that does not exist — eight of them are now closed, and this is
     * why none could have worked. The outlier is the other regime: stuck at range the skeleton
     * fires 41 and lands 6, about 15% against 50-70% point blank, which is the bot's jitter working
     * exactly as earlier passes measured and failing inside six blocks.
     *
     * <p>WHAT THAT LEAVES. At five blocks an arrow crosses in under two ticks, so reacting to the
     * ARROW cannot work — and every dodge this repo has built reacts to the arrow. The bow draw
     * takes TWENTY ticks and is visible client-side as the using-item flag (tracked data id 8, the
     * same flag whose event hook was too narrow to notice arrows at all). A full second of warning
