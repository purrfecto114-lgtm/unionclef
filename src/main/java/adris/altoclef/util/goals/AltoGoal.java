/**
 * Where the bot is trying to get to, owned by altoclef rather than by a pathfinder.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * G-0 is "stop depending on baritone", and the thing that actually holds altoclef to it is not an
 * algorithm — it is a TYPE. Counted across src/main: {@code baritone.api.pathing.goals.Goal} in 23
 * files, plus GoalNear, GoalBlock, GoalYLevel, GoalXZ and GoalRunAway in a dozen more. Every task
 * that wants to walk somewhere names a baritone class to say so, which is why the dependency
 * cannot be removed file by file.
 *
 * <p>A goal only ever answers two questions, and neither of them needs a pathfinder:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>WHERE should the bot head? — {@link #target()}, which is what the tungsten drive already
 *       reduces every baritone goal to (see {@code CustomTungstenGoalTask.goalToVec}, a chain of
 *       instanceof over six goal classes that exists purely to recover this vector);</li>
 *   <li>ARE WE THERE? — {@link #reached(BlockPos)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>With those two the drive needs no knowledge of goal classes at all, and a task can be moved
 * over one at a time while everything still compiles — the migration is mechanical rather than a
 * flag day.
 *
 * <p>The shapes are RECORDS rather than anonymous classes on purpose: while the legacy baritone
 * fallback is still wired up, one adapter has to translate a goal back into baritone's vocabulary,
 * and it can only do that if the shape is still visible. They also compare and print sensibly,
 * which the drive's debug lines rely on.

     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Baritone could consume those directly because it SEARCHED: a predicate is a perfectly good
     * goal function for A*, which visits candidate nodes and asks each one. The tungsten drive does
     * not search — it STEERS AT A POINT. That mismatch is what cost an earlier session 368 of 596
     * navigation entries and left the bot motionless for over four minutes, and it is why
     * {@code GoalRunAwayFromEntities} grew a {@code suggestFleePoint} and why {@link Flee} makes
     * its caller compute the point.
     *
     * <p>So the point search belongs in ONE place, done properly once, rather than open-coded per
     * goal: expansion order, a radius cap, and a cache so a target read every tick does not rescan
     * the world sixty times a second.
     *
     * <h2>Deliberately unused for now</h2>
     *
     * Nothing calls this yet. Wiring water, lava, flee and dodge onto it changes BEHAVIOUR on paths
     * the bot uses to survive, and that wants a pass which can watch nav_water and the mob suite
     * react. Adding the type alone cannot regress anything — no caller, no effect — and it leaves
     * the next pass four call sites instead of four designs.

     *
     * Upstream's {@code GoalRunAway} is a HEURISTIC over the whole search space -- every cell far
     * enough from the danger satisfies it -- so the search picks a reachable one by itself. Porting
     * it to "the caller computes a finished point" collapsed that to a single projected coordinate,
     * and the note on {@link Flee} says as much: fleeing is a direction, but a drive steers at
     * something. What it did not say is what happens when the something is inside a wall.
     *
     * <p>Which is the ordinary case for the caller that matters. {@code DestroyBlockTask} flees the
     * block it has just mined and passes that block's Y as maintainY, so a bot at the bottom of a
     * pit is sent "three blocks that way, at the depth I am digging" -- a point inside solid stone,
     * with the void underneath it. The search cannot reach it, burns its budget, restarts, and from
     * a 1x1 shaft the only direction a best-effort route can expand is UP. Measured over 35 runs of
     * mine_stone: 13 of 19 failures end with the bot on a cobblestone tower scoring exactly zero.
     *
     * <p>Vertical spread before horizontal: climbing out of the hole you are fleeing is usually one
     * step, and it is what a person would do. Beyond that it keeps walking outward, which is the
     * heuristic's own preference -- further away is better.
