/**
 * Tungsten pathfinder integration.
 *
 * When activated, Tungsten LOCKS control for LOCK_DURATION_MS so progress checkers
 * and shredder restarts don't immediately interrupt it.
 *
 * <p>HISTORY (2026-07-27): this class used to reach into tungsten through reflection,
 * "so it works even if tungsten is not installed". That was never true — the same class
 * already referenced {@code kaptainwutax.tungsten.task.*} directly in
 * {@link #isCombatActive()}, so tungsten was always a hard compile-time dependency and
 * the reflection bought nothing. Worse, it silently BROKE: {@code initReflection()} looked
 * up {@code PathFinder.searchTimeoutMs}, a field that had been moved to
 * {@link TungstenConfig}. The resulting {@code NoSuchFieldException} left
 * {@code reflectionReady = false} permanently, so {@code isTungstenLoaded()} always
 * returned false and every guarded method here — {@code tryPathTo}, {@code tryPathToEntity},
 * {@code stop}, {@code isActive}, {@code isLocked} — was a permanent no-op. The whole
 * "tungsten as a fallback when the primary pathfinder fails" layer had never executed.
 * It is now direct, typed calls: a signature change becomes a compile error instead of a
 * feature that silently disappears.

     * barren lock costs THIRTY SECONDS of a bot standing still, so the same five means

     *
     * <p>That is too lax twice over. As behaviour, two and a half minutes of no progress is not
     * patience, it is a hang. And as a TESTABLE guard it is worse: the craft courses run 90, 120,
     * 150, 180, 240 and 300 seconds, so at 150 s the guard cannot fire at all on the first four --
     * including mine_stone, the course this was found on. A guard that no course can exercise is
     * one this repo has now shipped three times, and it is the reason for two of the day's refuted
     * series.
     *
     * <p>Two barren locks is sixty seconds of getting nowhere toward one target, which is already
     * generous, and it is inside every course on the bench.
