/**
 * Walk -- or DIG -- until a block is within arm's reach. The approach a miner actually needs.
 *
 * <p>Three approaches to a block that must be broken were measured before this one and each has
 * a hole (see {@link GetWithinReachOfBlockTask}'s notes): occupying the cell is impossible while
 * the block stands; a distance radius is satisfied from behind an obstruction; reach-completion on
 * top of a distance goal freezes at the radius. The 2026-09-11 recorded playthrough named the
 * common cause (docs/BARITONE-GAPS.md G25): every one of them hands the navigator a POSITION the
 * walker cannot reach when the block is underground, so no engine that can dig is ever asked.
 *
 * <p>This task hands the navigator the BLOCK, with baritone's GoalGetToBlock semantics
 * ({@link AltoGoal.Adjacent}): the drive routes it straight to FastNavigator, whose planner
 * completes on any neighbouring cell and may break its way there (breakDown / breakThrough /
 * breakStair). Arrival is the adjacency test, or the miner's own: the block can be struck from
 * here.
