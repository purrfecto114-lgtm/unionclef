/**
 * Walk -- or BUILD, or DIG -- into the cell a settled drop lies in. The approach a pickup needs.
 *
 * <p>A dropped item that has come to rest is a place, not a moving target, and the recorded
 * 2026-09-11 playthrough (docs/BARITONE-GAPS.md G39) shows what it costs to treat it as one: raw
 * iron lay two blocks up a ledge, {@link GetToEntityTask} asked the physics engine for a route
 * ({@code TungstenHelper.tryPathToEntity}), the physics engine cannot place or break, so it
 * refused; the task then held forward against the ledge ("Walking straight at it (navigation
 * would not)"), wandered ("Failed exploring" x12), and abandoned the drop after 200 s. The one
 * engine that can pillar or carve a stair up two blocks -- FastPlanner, through FastNavigator --
 * was never asked, because nothing on the entity path leads to it.
 *
 * <p>This task puts the drop on the SAME road the blocks travel: an {@link AltoGoal#block}
 * goal on the drop's cell through {@code CustomTungstenGoalTask.driveTungstenPrimary}, whose
 * escalation ladder hands a goal the grid walker cannot reach to FastNavigator. Arrival is the
 * pickup itself -- the drop is gone, or the body is touching it -- since that is the only event
 * that ends a pickup; standing in the cell is merely how it comes about.
 *
 * <p>Only for a drop that has SETTLED (on the ground, not in water, not moving). A drop still
 * falling or floating downstream is a moving target and keeps the entity chase.

     * ItemEntity.tick adds gravity every tick (-0.04) and only calls move() -- which zeroes it on
     * collision -- every fourth tick while the item lies still, so the y component cycles
     * -0.04, -0.08, -0.12, 0. A test on the whole vector read "moving" on three ticks of four,
     * and the pickup flipped between this task and the entity chase at that cadence: measured on
     * drop_ledge phase B as the chain alternating "Getting to drop ... (dig/build allowed)" /
     * "Approach entity ... Tungsten locked" every few seconds with the body never moving, 2.4
     * blocks from the drop on a flat ledge top. TungstenHelper's own settled-drop test already
     * used the horizontal component only; this is the same test.
