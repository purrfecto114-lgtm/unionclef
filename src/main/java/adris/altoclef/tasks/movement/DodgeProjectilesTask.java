     * OFF BARITONE'S GOAL TYPE — and this one was not merely legacy, it was DEAD.
     *
     * <p>{@code GoalDodgeProjectiles} is a pure predicate: {@code isInGoal} plus a {@code
     * heuristic}, and no position of its own. {@code goalToVec} has no branch for it, so the drive
     * asked this task where to go and got NULL every tick, exactly as the flee goal did before it
     * grew a point. The heuristic that ranked "further from the arrow line" is read only by
     * shredder's A*. So on tungsten the bot has not been dodging: it stood on the arrow's line and
     * the task timed out.
     *
     * <p>{@link AltoGoal.NearestSatisfying} is the shape this needs, and its own javadoc names
     * "dodge — not on the arrow's line" as one of the four cases it was written for while noting
     * that nothing called it yet. This is the first caller.
     *
     * <p>LIMITATION, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: NearestSatisfying takes a FIXED origin, and
     * CustomTungstenGoalTask caches the goal, so the search always expands from where the bot
     * stood when the dodge began. The predicate is live — it re-reads the projectiles every tick —
     * but the origin is not. That is tolerable here only because the task carries a timeout
     * ({@code DODGE_TIMEOUT_MS}) and is recreated; it would not be tolerable for a long-lived goal.
