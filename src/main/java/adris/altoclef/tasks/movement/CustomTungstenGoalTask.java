 * Turns a navigation goal into a task, driven end-to-end by tungsten.
 *
 * <p>NAME, corrected 2026-10-04 (audit angle 4): this class was called
 * {@code CustomBaritoneGoalTask}. The Baritone it was named for has not been
 * compiled since the G-0 migration (2026-08-24) — the name outlived the engine
 * and actively misled name-based tooling (an AI reading the tree concluded
 * Baritone was still wired in). Renamed to match what it actually drives.
 * Historical documents (TODOS.md, release notes, ai/ audits) keep the old name
 * on purpose: they describe the past.
